Blockhain is essentially a repository of data that records transactions and places them in a nodal arrangement of computers. It stores information with foolproof time stamping for accelerated scalability of a project. While Bitcoin (BTC) democratized the creation of crypto currency, Ethereum provided us the concept of smart contracts. Flexsin is at the center of it all. We are capacitating the businesses with robust blockchain solutions.
